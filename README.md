# CS50W Project 0 - Search

## Description
This project is an educational front-end clone of Google Search, Google Image
Search, and Google Advanced Search. While the interface is recreated for
learning purposes, the search queries are powered by Google’s actual servers to
return real results. It was developed as a solution to Project 0 in Harvard University’s CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.
